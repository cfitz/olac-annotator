      The OLAC Movie & Video Credit Annotation Experiment is part of a larger project to improve
      access to film and video in libraries and archives. Inspired by the Functional Requirements for
      Bibliographic Records (FRBR) model, we plan to
    %p
      %ol
        %li 
          Deconstruct existing library catalog records for publications into works (original movies
          or programs), versions (attributes that make a difference for selection, such as director's
          cut vs. theatrical release, soundtrack and subtitle options or format, such as DVD or Blu-ray) and publications.

        %li
          Use this data to create a centralized search interface for film and video in libraries that focuses on the work (original movie or program), along the lines of our prototype.

        %li 
          Construct and maintain a database of information about moving image works, versions and publications to keep the search interface up to date.

      The OLAC Movie & Video Credit Annotation Experiment contributes to the first step. Library
      catalog records currently include many free-text credits, such as
    %p
      %blockquote 
        %p directed by Clint Eastwood
        %p screenplay by William Broyles Jr. and Paul Haggis

    %p They also contain standardized forms of names, such as
    %p
      %blockquote
        %p Eastwood, Clint, 1930-
    %p
      A person looking at the record can tell that Clint Eastwood directed the movie. A person could
      also use the standardized form of his name to find other movies involving Clint Eastwood since
      those records will have the same standardized form. However, it isn't easy for a computer to
      put these two pieces of information together to conclude that "Eastwood, Clint, 1930-" is the
      director of the movie.

      Natural language processing tries to bridge this gap by developing methods for a computer to
      analyze and work with naturally-occurring human language as opposed to structured input.
      We are using a natural language processor to help the computer connect up the names and
      roles in library records. However, the processor will work better if it is first fed a set of training
      data with the right answers. It would also be helpful to have a set of hand-annotated correct
      answers to use for evaluation purposes when experimenting with different approaches or
      algorithms. This is where you come in. By filling in the forms on this site with the correct
      answers, you will help us train the computer to do a better job of parsing the data in library
      records.

      If we are able to connect the roles and functions, it will enable us to create more flexible and
      useful displays and provide more targeted search options. Moving images are usually identified
      by title and year or title and director so if we can identify the director's name, it will make it
      easier to match library records with external information about the same moving image.
